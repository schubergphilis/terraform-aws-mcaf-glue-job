# Upgrading Notes

This document captures required refactoring on your part when upgrading to a module version that contains breaking changes.

## Upgrading to v3.0.0

This release adds full Glue 5.0 logging support including automatic CloudWatch log group management, KMS encryption, and the `logs:AssociateKmsKey` IAM permission required for security configurations.

### No action required for Glue 4.x callers

If you are not changing `glue_version`, the module behaves identically to v2.x. No variable changes, no resource replacements.

### Migrating from `glue_version = "4.0"` to `"5.0"`

Glue 5.0 uses a different logging architecture. When you upgrade `glue_version` to `"5.0"` the following resource changes will appear in your plan — all are expected and intentional:

* `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.default` is **destroyed** (the single log group used by Glue 4.x)
* `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.error` and `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.output` are **created** — the two log groups Glue 5.0 writes to

The new group names follow the Glue 5.0 convention:

* Without a security configuration: `/aws-glue/jobs/<job-name>/error` and `/aws-glue/jobs/<job-name>/output`
* With a security configuration: `/aws-glue/jobs/<security-config>-role/<role>/error` and `.../output`

Any existing CloudWatch dashboards, metric filters, or log insights queries pointing to the old group name (`/aws-glue/jobs/<job-name>`) will need to be updated to the new `/error` and `/output` suffixed group names.

The new group names are exposed via the `log_group_error_name` and `log_group_output_name` outputs to make referencing them from other resources straightforward.

### Security configuration and `logs:AssociateKmsKey`

When `security_configuration` is set, the module now automatically grants `logs:AssociateKmsKey` on `/aws-glue/jobs/*` to the Glue execution role. This permission is required by Glue 5.0 on every job run start when CloudWatch KMS encryption is enabled in the security configuration. No action is required from callers — if you were previously granting this permission manually, it can be removed.

## Upgrading to v2.0.0

### Variables (v2.0.0)

The following variables have been replaced:

* `role_arn` → `execution_role_custom.arn`
* `role_policy` → `execution_role.policy`

The following variables have been introduced:

* `execution_role.additional_policy_arns`. Add additional policy arns to the execution role.
